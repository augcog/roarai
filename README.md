# ROARAI: Assistant Discord Bot

## EduGPT
EduGPT is the main part that runs the TA Agent in Discord. In the backend, an RAG system is used to answer questions based on course material and online documentation.

## RAG
To prepare the vector database for the RAG system, the scraper is used for web scrapping the online documentation in different formats; embedding is used to create embedding for the RAG system.

## Finetune

For fine-tuning, the OpenOrca folder is used to generate an Orca-style dataset.
