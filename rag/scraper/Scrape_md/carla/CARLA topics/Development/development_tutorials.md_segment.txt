CARLA is open source and designed to be highly extensible. This  allows users to create custom functionality or content to suit specialized applications or specific needs. The following tutorials detail how to achieve specific development aims with the CARLA codebase:  - [__Make release__](tuto_D_make_release.md)- [__Upgrading content__](tuto_D_contribute_assets.md)- [__Create semantic tags__](tuto_D_create_semantic_tags.md)- [__Create new sensor__](tuto_D_create_sensor.md)- [__Preformance benchmarking__](adv_benchmarking.md)- [__Recorder file format__](ref_recorder_binary_file_format.md)- [__Collision boundaries__](tuto_D_generate_colliders.md)
=====================================

h2: Make a release
Contents:
If you want to develop your own fork of CARLA and publish releases of your code, follow [__this guide__](tuto_D_make_release.md).
=====================================

h2: Upgrading content
Contents:
Our content resides on a separate Git LFS repository. As part of our build system, we generate and upload a package containing the latest version of this content tagged with the current date and commit. Regularly, we upgrade the CARLA repository with a link to the latest version of the content package. Please follow [__these instructions__](tuto_D_contribute_assets.md) to upgrade content.
