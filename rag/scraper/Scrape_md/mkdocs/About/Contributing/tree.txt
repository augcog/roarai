have encountered is fixed in the git master. It is **strongly** recommended
that you do this within a [virtualenv].

```bash
pip install https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/archive/master.tar.gz
```

To run the tests, it is recommended that you use [Hatch].

Install Hatch using [pip] by running the command `pip install hatch`.
Then the test suite can be run for MkDocs by running the command `hatch run all` in the
root of your MkDocs repository.

It will attempt to run the tests against all of the Python versions we
support. So don't be concerned if you are missing some. The rest
will be verified by [GitHub Actions] when you submit a pull request.
