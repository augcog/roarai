## Compute Cost Calculator

- https://compute-cost.com 🌟
- This tool finds the lowest price of compute resources from different services (currently just in AWS). To balance simplicity and utility, only the most common features are available as filters.
- "As an AWS user, I often want to know the cheapest options for compute resources given some project-specific criteria. So, I made a tool to show me that data in a way that is useful to me. Maybe it will be useful to you" @ericwastl

### Replex

- [replex.io](https://www.replex.io/)
- [replex.io: An Introduction to Kubernetes FinOps](https://www.replex.io/blog/an-introduction-to-kubernetes-finops) FinOps is a cross domain discipline that represents a set of tools, best practices and processes aimed towards making software and infrastructure more cost effective. In this article we provide an introduction to Kubernetes Finops.

## Cost Optimization Tools

- [CAST AI](https://cast.ai/) cuts your cloud bill automatically so engineers can focus on building a better product
- [cremich/cdk-bill-bot: Welcome to Bill - the cost optimization bot](https://github.com/cremich/cdk-bill-bot) The serverless cost optimization bot. Bill enables AWS customers to proactively monitor their infrastructure costs and identify unforeseen expenses in a timely manner.
