- [==blog.frankel.ch: Introduction to Kubernetes extensibility== 🌟](https://blog.frankel.ch/kubernetes-extensibility/) In this article, you'll learn several extension points in Kubernetes: the data model, admission controllers, and client-side.
    - At its most basic level, Kubernetes is just a platform able to run container images. It stores its configuration in a distributed storage engine, etcd. The most significant part of this configuration is dedicated to the desired state for objects. For example, you only update this state when you schedule a pod using the kubectl command line.
    - Other components, called controllers, watch configuration changes and read the desired state. Then, they try to reconcile the desired state with the actual state. It’s nothing revolutionary: Puppet is based on the same control-loop approach, and AFAIK, Chef. Generally, a controller manages a single type of object, e.g., the DeploymentController manages deployments.
- [superorbital.io: Testing Production Kubernetes Controllers](https://superorbital.io/blog/testing-production-controllers/) Invasion of Kubernetes controllers, the word “cloud native” can be read as “implemented as a K8s controller”. If your controller relies heavily on interaction with the Kubernetes API across a set of resources, investing in tests makes more sense.

    - Kubernetes is the current de facto standard for the deployment and running of applications that are suitable for modern cloud platforms. A declarative way of defining infrastructure state using YAML allows a super easy definition of the scheme for the deployment of the application. Deploying stateless applications is not a big deal. On the other hand — deploying distributed stateful applications, configuring, and operating them is a challenging task.

    - Kubernetes addressed this issue by allowing developers to extend it, using the Kubernetes operator. The operator reacts to the custom resource and reconciliate the state in the cluster with the state defined in the custom resource, by implementing logic embedded in the operator itself.

    - When designing/writing an application, intended to run on the Kubernetes, one should take into account capabilities provided by Kubernetes and take that information when designing software architecture. It can speed up implementation, make an application more reliable and the code can focus more on business logic itself.

    - There are multiple ways to create an operator. You could write one from scratch using Kubernetes  client-go. It’s a tedious task and the learning curve is steep. As an alternative, multiple tools provide boilerplate code and speed up the writing of operators. Popular ones are Operatorsdk and Kubebuilder. The focus of the article will be on creating an operator using Kubebuilder. Let’s create an operator which will create a pod running a simple HTTP API and bind some data to the HTTP API.
