    - When people focusing more on the security of containers, distroless based images are frequently used to reduce the attack surface. In these images, the package manager, the non-dependent modules or libraries, even the shells are stripped off, only the app and its required dependencies are kept. For the statically linked executable, produced by golang for example, we can even use ‚Äúscratch‚Äù as the base.
    - The potential exploit of vulnerability is therefore greatly reduced. But, on the other hand, it is difficult to troubleshoot the application if even the shell is not available, leaving only the logs from the app.
    - In this paper, we will explore different options to facilitate debugging by bringing back the shell.

Many people think about starting an application in the cloud but rarely pay attention to how it ends. Once, we caught quite a few errors explicitly related to pods stopping. For example, we saw that Kubernetes occasionally kills our application before it releases resources, although it seems that this should not happen. It was impossible to reproduce the problem immediately, and we wondered what was happening under the hood?

This feature is primarily aimed at forensic analysis, but general backup-and-restore is something any Kubernetes user can take advantage of. So, let's take a look at this brand-new feature and see how we can enable it in our clusters and leverage it for backup-and-restore or forensic analysis.
