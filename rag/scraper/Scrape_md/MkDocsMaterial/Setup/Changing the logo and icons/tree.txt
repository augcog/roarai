#Changing the logo and icons (h1)

When installing Material for MkDocs, you immediately get access to _over 8,000
icons_ ready to be used for customization of specific parts of the theme and/or
when writing your documentation in Markdown. Not enough? You can also add
[additional icons] with minimal effort.

  [additional icons]: #additional-icons



##Configuration (h2)



###Logo (h3)

<!-- md:version 0.1.0 -->
<!-- md:default `material/library` -->

The logo can be changed to a user-provided image (any type, incl. `*.png` and
`*.svg`) located in the `docs` folder, or to any icon bundled with the theme.
Add the following lines to `mkdocs.yml`:

=== ":octicons-image-16: Image"

    ``` yaml
    theme:
      logo: assets/logo.png
    ```

=== ":octicons-package-16: Icon, bundled"

    ``` yaml
    theme:
      icon:
        logo: material/library # (1)!
    ```

    1.  Enter a few keywords to find the perfect icon using our [icon search] and
        click on the shortcode to copy it to your clipboard:

        <div class="mdx-iconsearch" data-mdx-component="iconsearch">
          <input class="md-input md-input--stretch mdx-iconsearch__input" placeholder="Search icon" data-mdx-component="iconsearch-query" value="material library" />
          <div class="mdx-iconsearch-result" data-mdx-component="iconsearch-result" data-mdx-mode="file">
            <div class="mdx-iconsearch-result__meta"></div>
            <ol class="mdx-iconsearch-result__list"></ol>
          </div>
        </div>

  [icon search]: ../reference/icons-emojis.md#search

Normally, the logo in the header and sidebar links to the homepage of the
documentation, which is the same as `site_url`. This behavior can be changed
with the following configuration:

``` yaml
extra:
  homepage: https://example.com
```

###Site icons (h3)

[:octicons-tag-24: 9.2.0][Site icon support]

Most icons you see on your site, such as navigation icons, can also be changed. For example,
to change the navigation arrows in the footer, add the following lines to `mkdocs.yml`:

```yaml
theme:
  icon:
    previous: fontawesome/solid/angle-left
    next: fontawesome/solid/angle-right
```

The following is a complete list of customizable icons used by the theme:
