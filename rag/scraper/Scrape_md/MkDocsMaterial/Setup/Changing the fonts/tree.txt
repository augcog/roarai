#Changing the fonts (h1)

Material for MkDocs makes it easy to change the typeface of your project
documentation, as it directly integrates with [Google Fonts]. Alternatively,
fonts can be custom-loaded if self-hosting is preferred for data privacy reasons
or another destination should be used.

  [Google Fonts]: https://fonts.google.com



##Configuration (h2)



###Regular font (h3)

<!-- md:version 0.1.2 -->
<!-- md:default [`Roboto`][Roboto] -->

The regular font is used for all body copy, headlines, and essentially
everything that does not need to be monospaced. It can be set to any
valid [Google Font][Google Fonts] via `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
theme:
  font:
    text: Roboto
```

The typeface will be loaded in 300, 400, _400i_ and __700__.

##Configuration (h2)



###Monospaced font (h3)

<!-- md:version 0.1.2 -->
<!-- md:default [`Roboto Mono`][Roboto Mono] -->

The _monospaced font_ is used for code blocks and can be configured separately.
Just like the regular font, it can be set to any valid [Google Font]
[Google Fonts] via `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
theme:
  font:
    code: Roboto Mono
```

The typeface will be loaded in 400.

or another destination should be used.

##Configuration (h2)



###Autoloading (h3)

<!-- md:version 1.0.0 -->
<!-- md:default none -->

If you want to prevent typefaces from being loaded from [Google Fonts], e.g.
to adhere to [data privacy] regulations, and fall back to system fonts, add the
following lines to `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
theme:
  font: false
```

!!! tip "Automatically bundle Google Fonts"

    The [built-in privacy plugin] makes it easy to use Google Fonts
    while complying with the __General Data Protection Regulation__ (GDPR),
    by automatically downloading and self-hosting the web font files.
