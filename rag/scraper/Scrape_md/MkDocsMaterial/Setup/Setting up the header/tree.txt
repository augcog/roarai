#Setting up the header (h1)

Material for MkDocs' header can be customized to show an announcement bar that
disappears upon scrolling, and provides some options for further configuration.
It also includes the [search bar] and a place to display your project's
[git repository], as explained in those dedicated guides.

  [search bar]: setting-up-site-search.md
  [git repository]: adding-a-git-repository.md



##Configuration (h2)



###Automatic hiding (h3)

<!-- md:version 6.2.0 -->
<!-- md:feature -->

When autohiding is enabled, the header is automatically hidden when the
user scrolls past a certain threshold, leaving more space for content. Add the
following lines to `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
theme:
  features:
    - header.autohide
```
