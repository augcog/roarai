#Built-in typeset plugin (h1)

The typeset plugin allows to preserve the enriched presentation of titles and
headlines within the navigation and table of contents. This means that code
blocks, icons, emojis and any other inline formatting can be rendered exactly
as defined in the page's content.



##Objective (h2)



###How it works (h3)

When [building your project], MkDocs extracts the plain text from headlines and
drops the original formatting. This is generally useful and a good idea, since
this information is made available to other plugins that might have problems
when being passed HTML instead of plain text.

However, it also means that the entire formatting is lost.

The plugin hooks into the rendering process, extracts the original headlines,
and makes them available to be used in templates and plugins. The templates of
Material for MkDocs use this information to render an enriched version of the
navigation and table of contents.

The typeset plugin allows to preserve the enriched presentation of titles and

blocks, icons, emojis and any other inline formatting can be rendered exactly
as defined in the page's content.



##Objective (h2)



###When to use it (h3)

It's generally recommended to use the plugin, because it is a drop-in solution
that doesn't require any configuration and is designed to work out of the box.
Since it doesn't overwrite but only adds information, it's not expected to
interfere with other plugins.
