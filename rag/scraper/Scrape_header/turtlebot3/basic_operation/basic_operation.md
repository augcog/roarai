## [Basic Operation](#basic-operation "#basic-operation")

### [Teleoperation](#teleoperation "#teleoperation")

**WARNING**: Make sure to run the [Bringup](/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/bringup/#bringup "/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/bringup/#bringup") from the TurtleBot3 SBC before teleoperation. Teleoperate the robot, and be careful when testing the robot on the table as the robot might fall.

The TurtleBot3 can be teleoperated by various remote controllers. Make sure that the necessary ROS packages are supported for your SBC and ROS version.

#### [Keyboard](#keyboard "#keyboard")

**TIP**: Before executing this command, you have to specify the model name of TurtleBot3. The `${TB3_MODEL}` is the name of the model you are using in `burger`, `waffle`, `waffle_pi`.

1. Launch `turtlebot3_teleop_key` node from Remote PC for the teleoperation using a keyboard. Replace the `${TB3_MODEL}` parameter with your model name such as `burger`, `waffle`, `waffle_pi`.

```
$ export TURTLEBOT3\_MODEL=${TB3\_MODEL}
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch

```
2. If the node is successfully launched, the following instruction will be appeared to the terminal window.

```
Control Your Turtlebot3
Moving around
     w
 a   s   d
     x
w/x : increase/decrease linear velocity
a/d : increase/decrease angular velocity
space key, s : force stop
CTRL-C to quit

```

![](/assets/images/icon_unfold.png) **Read more about How to predefine the TURTLEBOT3\_MODEL**

The `export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=${TB3_MODEL}` command can be omitted if the **TURTLEBOT3\_MODEL** parameter is predefined in the `.bashrc` file. The `.bashrc` file is automatically loaded when a terminal window is created.

* Example of defining TurtlBot3 Burger as a default.

```
$ echo 'export TURTLEBOT3\_MODEL=burger' >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc

```
* Example of defining TurtlBot3 Waffle Pi as a default.

```
$ echo 'export TURTLEBOT3\_MODEL=waffle\_pi' >> ~/.bashrc

```

#### [RC100](#rc100 "#rc100")

The settings for [ROBOTIS RC-100B](/docs/en/parts/communication/rc-100/ "/docs/en/parts/communication/rc-100/") controller is included in the OpenCR firmware for TurtleBot3 Burger, Waffle and Waffle Pi. This controller can be used with the Bluetooth module [BT410](/docs/en/parts/communication/bt-410/ "/docs/en/parts/communication/bt-410/"). The TurtleBot3 Waffle Pi includes the RC-100 controller and Bluetooth modules. When using RC-100, it is not necessary to execute a specific node because `turtlebot_core` node creates a `/cmd_vel` topic in the firmware directly connected to OpenCR.

![](/assets/images/platform/turtlebot3/example/rc100b_with_bt410.png)

1. Connect BT-410 to OpenCR UART1 port (as described [here](/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/appendix_opencr1_0/ "/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/appendix_opencr1_0/")).
2. Control TurtleBot3 with RC-100.

```

### [Topic Monitor](#topic-monitor "#topic-monitor")

![](/assets/images/icon_unfold.png) **Read more about Topic Monitor**

In order to check the topics of TurtleBot3, we will use [rqt](http://wiki.ros.org/rqt "http://wiki.ros.org/rqt") provided by ROS. The rqt is a Qt-based framework for GUI development for ROS. The rqt is a tool that allows users to easily see the topic status by displaying all the topics in the topic list. There are topic names, types, bandwidth, Hz, value in GUI.

1. Run the rqt from PC with the command below. If the topic monitor window is not displayed, select the `plugin` -> `Topics` -> `Topic Monitor`.

```
$ rqt

```

![](/assets/images/platform/turtlebot3/example/rqt_1.png)
2. When the topic monitor loaded, the topic values are not monitored. Click the checkbox next to each topic to monitor the topic.  

![](/assets/images/platform/turtlebot3/example/rqt_2.png)
3. To see more detailed topic message, click the `â–¶` icon next to the checkbox.  

![](/assets/images/platform/turtlebot3/example/rqt_3.png)

* `/battery_state` indicates a message relating to the battery condition, such as the current battery voltage and remaining capacity.  

![](/assets/images/platform/turtlebot3/example/rqt_4.png)
* `/diagnostics` indicates a message the status of the components connected to the TurtleBot3, such as a MPU9250, DYNAMIXEL-X, a HLS-LFCD-LDS, a battery and a OpenCR.  

![](/assets/images/platform/turtlebot3/example/rqt_5.png)
* `/odom` indicates a message the odometry of the TurtleBot3. This topic has orientation and position by the encoder data.  

![](/assets/images/platform/turtlebot3/example/rqt_6.png)
* `/sensor_state` indicates a message the encoder values, battery and torque.  

![](/assets/images/platform/turtlebot3/example/rqt_7.png)
* `/scan` indicates a message all of the LDS data, such as angle\_max and min, range\_max and min, indicates, ranges.

### [Topic Monitor](#topic-monitor "#topic-monitor")

![](/assets/images/icon_unfold.png) **Read more about Topic Monitor**

In order to check topics of TurtleBot3, Use [rqt](http://wiki.ros.org/rqt "http://wiki.ros.org/rqt") provided by ROS, which is a Qt-based framework for GUI development for ROS. It is a tool displaying all topics of TurtleBot3 with a topic name, type, bandwidth, Hz, and value.

1. Run the rqt from PC with the command below. If the topic monitor window is not displayed, select the `plugin` -> `Topics` -> `Topic Monitor`.

```
$ rqt

```

![](/assets/images/platform/turtlebot3/ros2/rqt_1.png)
2. When the topic monitor loaded, the topic values are not monitored. Click the checkbox next to each topic to monitor the topic.  

![](/assets/images/platform/turtlebot3/ros2/rqt_2.png)
3. To see more detailed topic message, click the `â–¶` icon next to the checkbox.

**WARNING**: Make sure to run the [Bringup](/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/bringup/#bringup "/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/bringup/#bringup") from the TurtleBot3 SBC before teleoperation. Teleoperate the robot, and be careful when testing the robot on the table as the robot might fall.

The TurtleBot3 can be teleoperated by various remote controllers. Make sure that the necessary ROS packages are supported for your SBC and ROS version.

#### [Keyboard](#keyboard "#keyboard")

1. Open a terminal on **Remote PC**.
2. Run teleoperation node. Replace the `${TB3_MODEL}` with `burger` or `waffle` or `waffle_pi`, if TURTLEBOT3\_MODEL parameter is not predefined.

```
$ export TURTLEBOT3\_MODEL=${TB3\_MODEL}
$ ros2 run turtlebot3_teleop teleop_keyboard

```
3. If the node is successfully launched, the following instruction will be appeared to the terminal window.

```
Control Your Turtlebot3
Moving around
     w

The TurtleBot3 can be teleoperated by various remote controllers. Make sure that the necessary ROS packages are supported for your SBC and ROS version.

#### [Keyboard](#keyboard "#keyboard")

**TIP**: Before executing this command, you have to specify the model name of TurtleBot3. The `${TB3_MODEL}` is the name of the model you are using in `burger`, `waffle`, `waffle_pi`.

1. Launch `turtlebot3_teleop_key` node from Remote PC for the teleoperation using a keyboard.  

 Please use the proper keyword among `burger`, `waffle`, `waffle_pi` for the `TURTLEBOT3_MODEL` parameter.

```
> set TURTLEBOT3\_MODEL=waffle
> roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch

```
2. If the node is successfully launched, the following instruction will be appeared to the terminal window.
