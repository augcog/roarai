* 360 Laser Distance Sensor LDS-02 is a 2D laser scanner capable of sensing 360 degrees that collects a set of data around the robot to use for SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) and Navigation.
* The LDS-02 is used for TurtleBot3 Burger and Waffle Pi models.
* Only Tx UART interface is available for the LDS-02 sensor.
* The USB interface(USB2LDS) supports easier connection to a PC or SBC.

h4: [Data Packet](#data-packet "#data-packet")
Contents:

The LDS-02 adopts one-way communication and begins to send measuring data packet once working stably without any instruction packet.

| Header | Length | Speed (2Byte) | Start Angle (2Byte) | Data (36Byte) | End Angle (2Byte) | Timestamp (2Byte) | CRC |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0x54 | 0x2C | Speed\_L, Speed\_H | Angle\_L, Angle\_H | Data | Angle\_L, Angle\_H | Time\_L, Time\_H | CRC |

The `Data (36Byte)` consists of 12 point measurements for distance(2Byte) and confidence(1Byte) as below.

| Point1 Distance (2Byte) | Point1 Confidence | Point2 Distance (2Byte) | Point2 Confidence | … | Point12 Distance (2Byte) | Point12 Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Distance\_L, Distance\_H | Confidence | Distance\_L, Distance\_H | Confidence | … | Distance\_L, Distance\_H | Confidence |

* Packet Example
	+ Speed : 0x0868 (2152 °/s)
	+ Start Angle : 0x7EAB (32427 divide by 100 = 324.27 °)
	+ End Angle : 0x82BE (33470 divide by 100 = 334.70 °)
	+ Timestamp : 0x1A3A (6714 ms)

| Header | Length | Speed (2Byte) | Start Angle (2Byte) | Data (36Byte) | End Angle (2Byte) | Timestamp (2Byte) | CRC |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0x54 | 0x2C | 0x68, 0x08 | 0xAB, 0x7E | Data | 0xBE, 0x82 | 0x3A, 0x1A | 0x50 |

* Data Example
	+ Point1 Distance : 0x00E0 (224 mm)
	+ Point1 Confidence : 0xE4 (228)
	+ Point2 Distance : 0x00DC (220 mm)
	+ Point2 Confidence : 0xE2 (226)
	+ Point12 Distance : 0x00B0 (176 mm)
