##[OpenCR Setup](#opencr-setup "#opencr-setup") (h2)

Please be aware that [OpenCR](/docs/en/parts/controller/opencr10/ "/docs/en/parts/controller/opencr10/") board manager **does not support Arduino IDE on ARM based SBC such as Raspberry Pi or NVidia Jetson**.  

In order to upload the [OpenCR](/docs/en/parts/controller/opencr10/ "/docs/en/parts/controller/opencr10/") firmware using Arduino IDE, please follow the below instructions on your PC.

1. Install Arduino IDE.
	* [Download the latest Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software "https://www.arduino.cc/en/software")
2. After completing the installation, run Arduino IDE.
3. Press `Ctrl` + `,` to open the Preferences menu
4. Enter below address in the `Additional Boards Manager URLs`.

5. Open the TurtleBot3 firmware. Depending on your platform, please select the correct firmware.
	* Burger : ***File > Examples > turtlebot3 > turtlebot3\_burger > turtlebot3\_core***
	* Waffle/Waffle Pi : ***File > Examples > turtlebot3 > turtlebot3\_waffle > turtlebot3\_core***
6. Connect [OpenCR](/docs/en/parts/controller/opencr10/ "/docs/en/parts/controller/opencr10/") to the PC and Select ***OpenCR > OpenCR Board*** from ***Tools > Board*** menu.
7. Select the [OpenCR](/docs/en/parts/controller/opencr10/ "/docs/en/parts/controller/opencr10/") connected USB port from ***Tools > Port*** menu.
8. Upload the TurtleBot3 firmware sketch with `Ctrl` + `U` or the upload icon.

9. If firmware upload fails, try uploading with the recovery mode. Below sequence activates the recovery mode of OpenCR. Under the recovery mode, the `STATUS` led of [OpenCR](/docs/en/parts/controller/opencr10/ "/docs/en/parts/controller/opencr10/") will blink periodically.
	* Hold down the `PUSH SW2` button.
	* Press the `Reset` button.
	* Release the `Reset` button.
	* Release the `PUSH SW2` button.

###[OpenCR Test](#opencr-test "#opencr-test") (h3)

**NOTE**: If the wheels do not move while performing OpenCR Test instruction, make sure to see “**[Setup DYNAMIXELs for TurtleBot3](/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/faq/#setup-dynamixels-for-turtlebot3 "/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/faq/#setup-dynamixels-for-turtlebot3")**” section to update the DYNAMIXEL’s configuration for use of TurtleBot3.

You can use `PUSH SW 1` and `PUSH SW 2` buttons to see whether your robot has been properly assembled. This process tests the left and right DYNAMIXEL’s and the [OpenCR](/docs/en/parts/controller/opencr10/ "/docs/en/parts/controller/opencr10/") board.

1. After assembling TurtleBot3, connect the power to [OpenCR](/docs/en/parts/controller/opencr10/ "/docs/en/parts/controller/opencr10/") and turn on the power switch of OpenCR. The red `Power LED` will be turned on.
2. Place the robot on the flat ground in a wide open area. For the test, safety radius of 1 meter (40 inches) is recommended.
3. Press and hold `PUSH SW 1` for a few seconds to command the robot to move 30 centimeters (about 12 inches) forward.
4. Press and hold `PUSH SW 2` for a few seconds to command the robot to rotate 180 degrees in place.
