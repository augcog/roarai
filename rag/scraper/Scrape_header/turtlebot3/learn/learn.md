## [AWS RoboMaker with Turtlebot3](#aws-robomaker-with-turtlebot3 "#aws-robomaker-with-turtlebot3")

[AWS RoboMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/robomaker/?nc1=h_ls "https://aws.amazon.com/robomaker/?nc1=h_ls") is a service that makes it easy to develop, test, and deploy intelligent robotics applications at scale. RoboMaker extends the most widely used open-source robotics software framework, Robot Operating System (ROS), with connectivity to cloud services. This includes AWS machine learning services, monitoring services, and analytics services that enable a robot to stream data, navigate, communicate, comprehend, and learn. RoboMaker provides a robotics development environment for application development, a robotics simulation service to accelerate application testing, and a robotics fleet management service for remote application deployment, update, and management.

## [Data Collection via Matlab](#data-collection-via-matlab "#data-collection-via-matlab")

Thanks to [Sebastian Castro](https://kr.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/3069683 "https://kr.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/3069683"), Robotics and AI educator at MathWorks, there is a great material for use of Matlab tools with ROS.

The post, [How Do Autonomous Systems “See”?](https://blogs.mathworks.com/racing-lounge/2018/09/12/autonomous-systems-sensors/ "https://blogs.mathworks.com/racing-lounge/2018/09/12/autonomous-systems-sensors/") explains deeply about the combination between Matlab tools and ROS; Particularly, Autonomous Drving through the TurtleBot3 AutoRace.

## [Youtube Course](#youtube-course "#youtube-course")

This ROS courses are a ROS robot programming guide based on the experiences we had accumulated from ROS projects like TurtleBot3, OpenCR and OpenManipulator. We tried to make this a comprehensive guide that covers all aspects necessary for a beginner in ROS. Topics such as embedded system, mobile robots, and robot arms programmed with ROS are included. For those who are new to ROS, there are footnotes throughout the courses providing more information on the web. Through this ROS courses and book, we hope that more people will be aware of and participate in bringing forward the ever-accelerating collective knowledge of Robotics Engineering.
