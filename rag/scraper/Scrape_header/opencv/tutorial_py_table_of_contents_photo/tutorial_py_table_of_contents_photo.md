Here you will learn different OpenCV functionalities related to Computational Photography like image denoising etc.

* [Image Denoising](../../d5/d69/tutorial_py_non_local_means.html "../../d5/d69/tutorial_py_non_local_means.html")

See a good technique to remove noises in images called Non-Local Means Denoising
* [Image Inpainting](../../df/d3d/tutorial_py_inpainting.html "../../df/d3d/tutorial_py_inpainting.html")

Do you have a old degraded photo with many black spots and strokes on it? Take it. Let's try to restore them with a technique called image inpainting.
* [High Dynamic Range (HDR)](../../d2/df0/tutorial_py_hdr.html "../../d2/df0/tutorial_py_hdr.html")

Learn how to merge exposure sequence and process high dynamic range images.
