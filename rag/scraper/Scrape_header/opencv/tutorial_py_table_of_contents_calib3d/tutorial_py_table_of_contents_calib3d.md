* [Camera Calibration](../../dc/dbb/tutorial_py_calibration.html "../../dc/dbb/tutorial_py_calibration.html")

Let's find how good is our camera. Is there any distortion in images taken with it? If so how to correct it?
* [Pose Estimation](../../d7/d53/tutorial_py_pose.html "../../d7/d53/tutorial_py_pose.html")

This is a small section which will help you to create some cool 3D effects with calib module.
* [Epipolar Geometry](../../da/de9/tutorial_py_epipolar_geometry.html "../../da/de9/tutorial_py_epipolar_geometry.html")

Let's understand epipolar geometry and epipolar constraint.
* [Depth Map from Stereo Images](../../dd/d53/tutorial_py_depthmap.html "../../dd/d53/tutorial_py_depthmap.html")

Extract depth information from 2D images.
