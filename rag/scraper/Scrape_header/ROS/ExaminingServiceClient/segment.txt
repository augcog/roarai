**Description:** This tutorial examines running the simple service and client.  

**Tutorial Level:** BEGINNER

 Contents1. [Running the Service](#Running_the_Service "#Running_the_Service")
2. [Running the Client](#Running_the_Client "#Running_the_Client")

=====================================

h2: Running the Service
Contents:

Let's start by running the service: 
```
$ rosrun beginner_tutorials add_two_ints_server     (C++)
$ rosrun beginner_tutorials add_two_ints_server.py  (Python) 
```
You should see something similar to: 
```
Ready to add two ints.
```


=====================================

h2: Running the Client
Contents:

Now let's run the client with the necessary arguments: 
```
$ rosrun beginner_tutorials add_two_ints_client 1 3     (C++)
$ rosrun beginner_tutorials add_two_ints_client.py 1 3  (Python) 
```
You should see something similar to: 
```
Requesting 1+3
1 + 3 = 4
```
Now that you've successfully run your first server and client, let's learn how to [record and play back data](/ROS/Tutorials/Recording%20and%20playing%20back%20data "/ROS/Tutorials/Recording%20and%20playing%20back%20data").

h2: Further examples on Service and Client nodes
Contents:

If you want to investigate further and get a hands-on example, you can get one [here](https://github.com/fairlight1337/ros_service_examples/ "https://github.com/fairlight1337/ros_service_examples/"). A simple Client and Service combination shows the use of custom message types. The Service node is written in C++ while the Client is available in C++, Python and LISP.
