#Overview (h1)

ROS is designed with distributed computing in mind. A well-written node makes no assumptions about where in the network it runs, allowing computation to be relocated at run-time to match the available resources (there are exceptions; for example, a driver node that communicate with a piece of hardware must run on the machine to which the hardware is physically connected). Deploying a ROS system across multiple machines is easy. Keep the following things in mind: * You only need one master. Select one machine to run it on.
* All nodes must be configured to use the same master, via ROS\_MASTER\_URI.
* There must be complete, bi-directional connectivity between all pairs of machines, on all ports (see [ROS/NetworkSetup](/ROS/NetworkSetup "/ROS/NetworkSetup")).
* Each machine must advertise itself by a name that all other machines can resolve (see [ROS/NetworkSetup](/ROS/NetworkSetup "/ROS/NetworkSetup")).

#Talker / listener across two machines (h1)

Say we want to run a talker / listener system across two machines, named **marvin** and **hal**. These are the machines' hostnames, which means that these are the names by which you would address them when. E.g., to login to **marvin**, you would do: 
```
ssh marvin
```
Same goes for **hal**. 

##Start the master (h2)

We need to select one machine to run the master; we'll go with **hal**. The first step is start the master: 
```
ssh hal
roscore
```

#Talker / listener across two machines (h1)

Say we want to run a talker / listener system across two machines, named **marvin** and **hal**. These are the machines' hostnames, which means that these are the names by which you would address them when. E.g., to login to **marvin**, you would do: 
```
ssh marvin
```
Same goes for **hal**. 

##Start the listener (h2)

Now we'll start a listener on **hal**, configuring ROS\_MASTER\_URI so that we use the master that was just started: 
```
ssh hal
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://hal:11311
rosrun rospy_tutorials listener.py
```

#Talker / listener across two machines (h1)

Say we want to run a talker / listener system across two machines, named **marvin** and **hal**. These are the machines' hostnames, which means that these are the names by which you would address them when. E.g., to login to **marvin**, you would do: 
```
ssh marvin
```
Same goes for **hal**. 

##Start the talker (h2)

Next we'll start a talker on **marvin**, also configuring ROS\_MASTER\_URI so that the master on **hal** is used: 
```
ssh marvin
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://hal:11311
rosrun rospy_tutorials talker.py
```
Voila: you should now see the listener on **hal** receiving messages from the talker on **marvin**. Note that the sequence of talker / listener startup doesn't matter; the nodes can be started in any order. The only requirement is that you start the master before starting any nodes.

```
ssh marvin
```
Same goes for **hal**. 

##Variation: connecting in the other direction (h2)

Now let's try it in the other direction. Leaving the master running on **hal**, kill the talker and listener, then bring them up on opposite machines. First a listener on **marvin**: 
```
ssh marvin
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://hal:11311
rosrun rospy_tutorials listener.py
```
Now a talker on **hal**: 
```
ssh hal
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://hal:11311
rosrun rospy_tutorials talker.py
```

#rostopic (h1)

For testing you can use the [rostopic](/rostopic "/rostopic") tool on all machines which are connected to the core. You get a list of all available topics. If you are not connected to a core there is an error. 
```
rostopic list
```
In wireless networks it is sometimes necessary to check if there is a connection and messages still come. For short tests it is handy to print out the messages. 
```
rostopic echo /topic_name
```

#When something goes wrong (h1)

If something in the above sequence didn't work, the cause is likely in your network configuration. See [ROS/NetworkSetup](/ROS/NetworkSetup "/ROS/NetworkSetup") and [ROS/Troubleshooting](/ROS/Troubleshooting "/ROS/Troubleshooting") for configuration requirements and troubleshooting tips. One common trap is the missing define of ROS\_IP on the machine, where talker.py is running. check it with: echo $ROS\_IP If you dont't define ROS\_IP, then rostopic info will show indeed the proper connections of publisher and listener, but rostopic echo will be empty. You will see no TX-traffic on LAN, on machine with talker. First, after defining ROS\_IP with proper IP-address ( export ROS\_IP=machine\_ip\_addr) you will see trafic on LAN and the listener.py will show received data.
