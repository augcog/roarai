Machine learning is a data analysis technique that teaches computers to recognize what is natural for people and animals - learning through experience. There are three types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning.

This application is reinforcement learning with DQN (Deep Q-Learning). The reinforcement learning is concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.

The contents in e-Manual are subject to be updated without a prior notice. Therefore, some video may differ from the contents in e-Manual.

This shows reinforcement learning with TurtleBot3 in gazebo.
This reinforcement learning is applied DQN(Deep Q-Learning) algorithm with LDS.  

We are preparing a four-step reinforcement learning tutorial.

h2: [Set parameters](#set-parameters "#set-parameters")
Contents:

The goal of DQN Agent is to get the TurtleBot3 to the goal avoiding obstacles. When TurtleBot3 gets closer to the goal, it gets a positive reward, and when it gets farther it gets a negative reward.
The episode ends when the TurtleBot3 crashes on an obstacle or after a certain period of time. During the episode, TurtleBot3 gets a big positive reward when it gets to the goal, and TurtleBot3 gets a big negative reward when it crashes on an obstacle.

The contents in e-Manual are subject to be updated without a prior notice. Therefore, some video may differ from the contents in e-Manual.


=====================================

h3: [Set state](#set-state "#set-state")
Contents:

State is an observation of environment and describes the current situation. Here, `state_size` is 26 and has 24 LDS values, distance to goal, and angle to goal.

Turtlebot3â€™s LDS default is set to 360. You can modify sample of LDS at `turtlebot3/turtlebot3_description/urdf/turtlebot3_burger.gazebo.xacro`.

```
<xacro:arg name="laser\_visual" default="false"/>   # Visualization of LDS. If you want to see LDS, set to `true`

```

```

=====================================

h3: [Set action](#set-action "#set-action")
Contents:

Action is what an agent can do in each state. Here, turtlebot3 has always 0.15 m/s of linear velocity. angular velocity is determined by action.

| Action | Angular velocity(rad/s) |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | -1.5 |
| 1 | -0.75 |
| 2 | 0 |
| 3 | 0.75 |
| 4 | 1.5 |


=====================================

h3: [Set reward](#set-reward "#set-reward")
Contents:

When turtlebot3 takes an action in a state, it receives a reward. The reward design is very important for learning. A reward can be positive or negative. When turtlebot3 gets to the goal, it gets big positive reward. When turtlebot3
collides with an obstacle, it gets big negative reward. If you want to apply your reward design, modify `setReward` function at `/turtlebot3_machine_learning/turtlebot3_dqn/src/turtlebot3_dqn/environment_stage_#.py`.


=====================================

h3: [Set hyper parameters](#set-hyper-parameters "#set-hyper-parameters")
Contents:

This tutorial has been learned using DQN. DQN is a reinforcement learning method that selects a deep neural network by approximating the action-value function(Q-value). Agent has follow hyper parameters at `/turtlebot3_machine_learning/turtlebot3_dqn/nodes/turtlebot3_dqn_stage_#`.

| Hyper parameter | default | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| episode\_step | 6000 | The time step of one episode. |
| target\_update | 2000 | Update rate of target network. |
| discount\_factor | 0.99 | Represents how much future events lose their value according to how far away. |
| learning\_rate | 0.00025 | Learning speed. If the value is too large, learning does not work well, and if it is too small, learning time is long. |
| epsilon | 1.0 | The probability of choosing a random action. |
| epsilon\_decay | 0.99 | Reduction rate of epsilon. When one episode ends, the epsilon reduce. |
| epsilon\_min | 0.05 | The minimum of epsilon. |
| batch\_size | 64 | Size of a group of training samples. |
| train\_start | 64 | Start training if the replay memory size is greater than 64. |
| memory | 1000000 | The size of replay memory. |

The goal of DQN Agent is to get TurtleBot3 to the goal to avoid obstacles. 
The closer TurtleBot3 gets to, the more positive reward it gets. When TurtleBot3 gets closer to the goal, it gets a positive reward. When it gets farther it gets a negative reward.
The episode ends when the TurtleBot3 crashes on an obstacle or after a certain period of time. During the episode, TurtleBot3 gets a big positive reward when it gets to the goal, and TurtleBot3 gets a big negative reward when it crashes on an obstacle.
