  Large parts of this manual originate from Travis E. Oliphant's book
  `Guide to NumPy <https://archive.org/details/NumPyBook>`__ (which generously
  entered Public Domain in August 2008). The reference documentation for many of
  the functions are written by numerous contributors and developers of
  NumPy.
