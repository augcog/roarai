#NumPy 1.10.4 Release Notes (h1)

This release is a bugfix source release motivated by a segfault regression.
No windows binaries are provided for this release, as there appear to be
bugs in the toolchain we use to generate those files. Hopefully that
problem will be fixed for the next release. In the meantime, we suggest
using one of the providers of windows binaries.

* The trace function now calls the trace method on subclasses of ndarray,
except for matrix, for which the current behavior is preserved. This is
to help with the units package of AstroPy and hopefully will not cause
problems.
