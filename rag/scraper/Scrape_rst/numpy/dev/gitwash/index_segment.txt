  These pages describe a general git_ and github_ workflow.
  
  This is not a comprehensive git_ reference. It's tailored to the github_
  hosting service. You may well find better or quicker ways of getting stuff done
  with git_, but these should get you started.
  
  For general resources for learning git_ see :ref:`git-resources`.
