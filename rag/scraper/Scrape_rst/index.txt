**The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software libraries and
tools for building robot applications.** From drivers and state-of-
the-art algorithms to powerful developer tools, ROS has the open
source tools you need for your next robotics project.

Since ROS was started in 2007, a lot has changed in the robotics and
ROS community. The goal of the ROS 2 project is to adapt to these
changes, leveraging what is great about ROS 1 and improving what
isnâ€™t.

This site contains the documentation for ROS 2. If you are looking for
ROS 1 documentation, check out the ROS wiki.

If you use ROS 2 in your work, please see >>:doc:`Citations
<Citations>`<< to cite ROS 2.
