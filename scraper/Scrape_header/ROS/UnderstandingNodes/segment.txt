h1: Understanding ROS Nodes
Contents:

**Description:** This tutorial introduces ROS graph concepts and discusses the use of [roscore](/roscore "/roscore"), [rosnode](/rosnode "/rosnode"), and [rosrun](/rosrun "/rosrun") commandline tools.  

**Tutorial Level:** BEGINNER  

**Next Tutorial:** [Understanding ROS topics](/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingTopics "/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingTopics")

=====================================

h2: Prerequisites
Contents:

For this tutorial we'll use a lighweight simulator, to install it run the following command: 
```
$ sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-ros-tutorials
```
Replace '<distro>' with the name of your ROS distribution (e.g. indigo, jade, kinetic, noetic) 

=====================================

h2: Quick Overview of Graph Concepts
Contents:

* [Nodes](/Nodes "/Nodes"): A node is an executable that uses ROS to communicate with other nodes.
* [Messages](/Messages "/Messages"): ROS data type used when subscribing or publishing to a topic.
* [Topics](/Topics "/Topics"): Nodes can *publish* messages to a topic as well as *subscribe* to a topic to receive messages.
* [Master](/Master "/Master"): Name service for ROS (i.e. helps nodes find each other)
* [rosout](/rosout "/rosout"): ROS equivalent of stdout/stderr
* [roscore](/roscore "/roscore"): Master + rosout + parameter server (parameter server will be introduced later)


=====================================

h2: Nodes
Contents:

A node really isn't much more than an executable file within a ROS package. ROS nodes use a ROS client library to communicate with other nodes. Nodes can publish or subscribe to a Topic. Nodes can also provide or use a Service. 

=====================================

h2: Client Libraries
Contents:

ROS client libraries allow nodes written in different programming languages to communicate: * rospy = python client library
* roscpp = c++ client library


=====================================

h2: roscore
Contents:

roscore is the first thing you should run when using ROS. Please run: 
```
$ roscore
```
You will see something similar to: * 
```
... logging to ~/.ros/log/9cf88ce4-b14d-11df-8a75-00251148e8cf/roslaunch-machine_name-13039.log
Checking log directory for disk usage. This may take awhile.
Press Ctrl-C to interrupt

SUMMARY

PARAMETERS
 * /rosversion
 * /rosdistro

NODES

auto-starting new master
process[master]: started with pid [13054]
ROS_MASTER_URI=http://machine_name:11311/

setting /run_id to 9cf88ce4-b14d-11df-8a75-00251148e8cf
process[rosout-1]: started with pid [13067]
started core service [/rosout]
```

If roscore does not initialize, you probably have a network configuration issue. See [Network Setup - Single Machine Configuration](http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/NetworkSetup#Single_machine_configuration "http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/NetworkSetup#Single_machine_configuration") If roscore does not initialize and sends a message about lack of permissions, probably the ~/.ros folder is owned by root, change recursively the ownership of that folder with: 
```
$ sudo chown -R <your_username> ~/.ros
```


=====================================

h2: Using rosnode
Contents:

Open up a **new terminal**, and let's use **rosnode** to see what running roscore did... Bear in mind to keep the previous terminal open either by opening a new tab or simply minimizing it. **Note:** When opening a new terminal your environment is reset and your ~/.bashrc file is sourced. If you have trouble running commands like rosnode then you might need to add some environment setup files to your ~/.bashrc or manually re-source them. 

rosnode displays information about the ROS nodes that are currently running. The rosnode list command lists these active nodes: 
```
$ rosnode list
```
* You will see:
* 
```
/rosout
```

This showed us that there is only one node running: [rosout](/rosout "/rosout"). This is always running as it collects and logs nodes' debugging output. The rosnode info command returns information about a specific node. 
```
$ rosnode info /rosout
```
This gave us some more information about rosout, such as the fact that it publishes /rosout\_agg. * 
```
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Node [/rosout]
Publications:
 * /rosout_agg [rosgraph_msgs/Log]

Subscriptions:
 * /rosout [unknown type]

Services:
 * /rosout/get_loggers
 * /rosout/set_logger_level

contacting node http://machine_name:54614/ ...
Pid: 5092
```

Now, let's see some more nodes. For this, we're going to use rosrun to bring up another node. 

=====================================

h2: Using rosrun
Contents:

rosrun allows you to use the package name to directly run a node within a package (without having to know the package path). Usage: 
```
$ rosrun [package_name] [node_name]
```
So now we can run the turtlesim\_node in the turtlesim package. Then, in a **new terminal**: 
```
$ rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node
```
You will see the turtlesim window: * ![turtlesim.png](/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingNodes?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=turtlesim.png "turtlesim.png")

**NOTE:** The turtle may look different in your turtlesim window. Don't worry about it - there are [many types of turtle](/Distributions#Current_Distribution_Releases "/Distributions#Current_Distribution_Releases") and yours is a surprise! In a **new terminal**: 
```
$ rosnode list
```
You will see something similar to: * 
```
/rosout
/turtlesim
```

One powerful feature of ROS is that you can reassign Names from the command-line. Close the turtlesim window to stop the node (or go back to the rosrun turtlesim terminal and use ctrl-C). Now let's re-run it, but this time use a [Remapping Argument](/Remapping%20Arguments "/Remapping%20Arguments") to change the node's name: 
```
$ rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node __name:=my_turtle
```
Now, if we go back and use rosnode list: 
```
$ rosnode list
```
* You will see something similar to:
* 
```
/my_turtle
/rosout
```

Note: If you still see /turtlesim in the list, it might mean that you stopped the node in the terminal using ctrl-C instead of closing the window, or that you don't have the $ROS\_HOSTNAME environment variable defined as described in [Network Setup - Single Machine Configuration](http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/NetworkSetup#Single_machine_configuration "http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/NetworkSetup#Single_machine_configuration"). You can try cleaning the rosnode list with: $ rosnode cleanup 

We see our new /my\_turtle node. Let's use another rosnode command, ping, to test that it's up: 
```
$ rosnode ping my_turtle
```
* 
```
rosnode: node is [/my_turtle]
pinging /my_turtle with a timeout of 3.0s
xmlrpc reply from http://aqy:42235/     time=1.152992ms
xmlrpc reply from http://aqy:42235/     time=1.120090ms
xmlrpc reply from http://aqy:42235/     time=1.700878ms
xmlrpc reply from http://aqy:42235/     time=1.127958ms
```


=====================================

h2: Review
Contents:

What was covered: * roscore = ros+core : master (provides name service for ROS) + rosout (stdout/stderr) + parameter server (parameter server will be introduced later)
* rosnode = ros+node : ROS tool to get information about a node.
* rosrun = ros+run : runs a node from a given package.

Now that you understand how ROS nodes work, let's look at [how ROS topics work](/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingTopics "/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingTopics"). Also, feel free to press Ctrl-C to stop turtlesim\_node.
