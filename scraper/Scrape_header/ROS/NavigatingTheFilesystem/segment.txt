=====================================

h2: Prerequisites
Contents:

For this tutorial we will inspect a package in ros-tutorials, please install it using 
```
$ sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-ros-tutorials
```
Replace '<distro>' (including the '<>') with the name of your [ROS distribution](/Distributions "/Distributions") (e.g. indigo, kinetic, lunar etc.) 

=====================================

h2: Quick Overview of Filesystem Concepts
Contents:

* **Packages:** Packages are the software organization unit of ROS code. Each package can contain libraries, executables, scripts, or other artifacts.
* **Manifests ([package.xml](/catkin/package.xml "/catkin/package.xml")):** A manifest is a description of a *package*. It serves to define dependencies between *packages* and to capture meta information about the *package* like version, maintainer, license, etc...

Note about stacks
Note about stacks
**Note:** [rosbuild](/rosbuild "/rosbuild") users might be wondering where stacks went. The concept of stacks was removed with catkin to simplify the growing code base and to support better distribution of packages. In [catkin](/catkin "/catkin") you can define [metapackages](/catkin/migrating_from_rosbuild#Metapackages_and_the_Elimination_of_Stacks "/catkin/migrating_from_rosbuild#Metapackages_and_the_Elimination_of_Stacks") to collect similar packages and multiple packages can reside in a single VCS repository. Those two features replace the functionality of stacks. 


=====================================

h2: Filesystem Tools
Contents:

Code is spread across many ROS packages. Navigating with command-line tools such as ls and cd can be very tedious which is why ROS provides tools to help you. 

=====================================

h3: Using rospack and rosstack
Contents:

[rospack](/rospack "/rospack") and [rosstack](/rosstack "/rosstack") allow you to get information about packages and stacks. In this tutorial, we are only going to cover the find option, which returns the path to package or stack. Usage: 
```
$ rospack find [package_name]
$ rosstack find [stack_name]
```
Example: 
```
$ rospack find roscpp
```
Would return: * 
```
YOUR_INSTALL_PATH/share/roscpp
```

If, for example, you have used the [binary install](/fuerte/Installation/Ubuntu "/fuerte/Installation/Ubuntu") of [ROS Fuerte](/fuerte "/fuerte") on Ubuntu linux, you would see exactly: * 
```
/opt/ros/fuerte/share/roscpp
```


=====================================

h3: Using roscd
Contents:

[roscd](/rosbash#roscd "/rosbash#roscd") is part of the [rosbash](/rosbash "/rosbash") suite. It allows you to change directory ([cd](http://ss64.com/bash/cd.html "http://ss64.com/bash/cd.html")) directly to a package or a stack. Usage: 
```
$ roscd <package-or-stack>[/subdir]
```
To verify that we have changed to the roscpp package directory, run this example: 
```
$ roscd roscpp
```
Now let's print the working directory using the Unix command [pwd](http://ss64.com/bash/pwd.html "http://ss64.com/bash/pwd.html"): 
```
$ pwd
```
You should see: * 
```
YOUR_INSTALL_PATH/share/roscpp
```

You can see that YOUR\_INSTALL\_PATH/share/roscpp is the same path that rospackÂ find gave in the previous example. Note that [roscd](/roscd "/roscd"), like other ROS tools, will *only* find ROS packages that are within the directories listed in your [ROS\_PACKAGE\_PATH](/ROS/EnvironmentVariables#ROS_PACKAGE_PATH "/ROS/EnvironmentVariables#ROS_PACKAGE_PATH"). To see what is in your [ROS\_PACKAGE\_PATH](/ROS/EnvironmentVariables#ROS_PACKAGE_PATH "/ROS/EnvironmentVariables#ROS_PACKAGE_PATH"), type: 
```
$ echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
```
Your [ROS\_PACKAGE\_PATH](/ROS/EnvironmentVariables#ROS_PACKAGE_PATH "/ROS/EnvironmentVariables#ROS_PACKAGE_PATH") should contain a list of directories where you have ROS packages separated by colons. A typical [ROS\_PACKAGE\_PATH](/ROS/EnvironmentVariables#ROS_PACKAGE_PATH "/ROS/EnvironmentVariables#ROS_PACKAGE_PATH") might look like this: * 
```
/opt/ros/kinetic/base/install/share
```

Similarly to other environment paths, you can add additional directories to your [ROS\_PACKAGE\_PATH](/ROS/EnvironmentVariables#ROS_PACKAGE_PATH "/ROS/EnvironmentVariables#ROS_PACKAGE_PATH"), with each path separated by a colon ':'. 

=====================================

h4: Subdirectories
Contents:

[roscd](/rosbash#roscd "/rosbash#roscd") can also move to a subdirectory of a package or stack. Try: 
```
$ roscd roscpp/cmake
$ pwd
```
You should see: * 
```
YOUR_INSTALL_PATH/share/roscpp/cmake
```


=====================================

h3: Special cases for roscd
Contents:

There are a few special places you can tell roscd to go, that are not a package or stack. 

=====================================

h4: roscd with no arguments
Contents:

roscd without an argument will take you to $ROS\_WORKSPACE. Try: 
```
$ roscd
$ pwd
```
You should see: * 
```
 /home/user/fuerte_workspace
```

Note: Prior to Fuerte, roscd would take you to $ROS\_ROOT. 

=====================================

h4: roscd log
Contents:

roscdÂ log will take you to the folder where ROS stores log files. Note that if you have not run any ROS programs yet, this will yield an error saying that it does not yet exist. If you have run some ROS program before, try: 
```
$ roscd log
```


=====================================

h3: Using rosls
Contents:

[rosls](/rosbash#rosls "/rosbash#rosls") is part of the [rosbash](/rosbash "/rosbash") suite. It allows you to [ls](http://ss64.com/bash/ls.html "http://ss64.com/bash/ls.html") directly in a package by name rather than by absolute path. Usage: 
```
$ rosls <package-or-stack>[/subdir]
```
Example: 
```
$ rosls roscpp_tutorials
```
would return: * 
```
cmake launch package.xml  srv
```


=====================================

h3: Tab Completion
Contents:

It can get tedious to type out an entire package name. In the previous example, roscpp\_tutorials is a fairly long name. Luckily, some ROS tools support [TAB completion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_line_completion "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_line_completion"). Start by typing: 
```
$ roscd roscpp_tut<<< now push the TAB key >>>
```
After pushing the **TAB** key, the command line should fill out the rest: 
```
$ roscd roscpp_tutorials/
```
This works because roscpp\_tutorials is currently the only ROS package that starts with roscpp\_tut. Now try typing: 
```
$ roscd tur<<< now push the TAB key >>>
```
After pushing the **TAB** key, the command line should fill out as much as possible: 
```
$ roscd turtle
```
However, in this case there are multiple packages that begin with turtle. Try typing **TAB** another time. This should display all the ROS packages that begin with turtle: * 
```
turtle_actionlib/  turtlesim/         turtle_tf/
```

On the command line you should still have: 
```
$ roscd turtle
```
Now type an s after turtle and then push **TAB**: 
```
$ roscd turtles<<< now push the TAB key >>>
```
Since there is only one package that starts with turtles, you should see: 
```
$ roscd turtlesim/
```
If you want to see a list of all currently installed packages, you can use tab completion for that as well: 
```
$ rosls <<< now push the TAB key twice >>>
```


=====================================

h2: Review
Contents:

You may have noticed a pattern with the naming of the ROS tools: * rospack = ros + pack(age)
* roscd = ros + cd
* rosls = ros + ls

This naming pattern holds for many of the ROS tools. 

Now that you can get around in ROS, let's [create a package](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage "http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage").

Contents:

[rospack](/rospack "/rospack") allows you to get information about packages. In this tutorial, we are only going to cover the find option, which returns the path to package. Usage: 
```
$ rospack find [package_name]
```
Example: 
```
$ rospack find roscpp

If you installed ROS Kinetic from apt on Ubuntu Linux you would see exactly: * 
```
/opt/ros/kinetic/share/roscpp
```

h3: roscd log
Contents:

roscdÂ log will take you to the folder where ROS stores log files. Note that if you have not run any ROS programs yet, this will yield an error saying that it does not yet exist. If you have run some ROS program before, try: 
```
$ roscd log
