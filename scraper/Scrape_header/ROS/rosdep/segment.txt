h1: Managing System dependencies

**Description:** This explains how to use [rosdep](/rosdep "/rosdep") to install system dependencies.  

**Tutorial Level:** INTERMEDIATE

h2: System Dependencies
Contents:

ROS packages sometimes require external libraries and tools that must be provided by the operating system. These required libraries and tools are commonly referred to as *system dependencies*. In some cases these *system dependencies* are not installed by default. ROS provides a simple tool, rosdep, that is used to download and install *system dependencies*. ROS packages must declare that they need these *system dependencies* in the package manifest. Let's look at the manifest for the turtlesim package: 
```
$ roscd turtlesim
```
Then, 
```
$ cat package.xml
```
* 
```
<package>

...
...
  <build_depend>message_generation</build_depend>
  <build_depend>libqt4-dev</build_depend>
  <build_depend>qt4-qmake</build_depend>
  <build_depend>rosconsole</build_depend>
  <build_depend>roscpp</build_depend>
  <build_depend>roscpp_serialization</build_depend>
  <build_depend>roslib</build_depend>
  <build_depend>rostime</build_depend>
  <build_depend>std_msgs</build_depend>
  <build_depend>std_srvs</build_depend>
</package>
```

As you can see [turtlesim](/turtlesim "/turtlesim") needs those libraries and packages. 

```
$ cat manifest.xml
```
* 
```
<package>

...
...
    <rosdep name="libqt4-dev"/>
    <rosdep name="qt4-qmake"/>

</package>
```

As you can see [turtlesim](/turtlesim "/turtlesim") needs libqt4-dev and qt4-qmake. 


=====================================

h3: rosdep
Contents:

rosdep is a tool you can use to install system dependencies required by ROS packages. Usage: 
```
rosdep install [package]
```
Download and install the system dependencies for turtlesim: 
```
$ rosdep install turtlesim
```
If you've been following along with the tutorials, it's likely that this is the first time you've used rosdep. When you run this command, you'll get an error message: * 
```
ERROR: your rosdep installation has not been initialized yet.  Please run:

    sudo rosdep init
    rosdep update
```

Just run those two commands and then try to install turtlesim's dependencies again. If you installed using binaries you will see: * 
```
All required rosdeps installed successfully
```

Otherwise you will see the output of installing the dependencies of turtlesim: * 
```
#!/usr/bin/bash

set -o errexit
set -o verbose

if [ ! -f /opt/ros/lib/libboost_date_time-gcc42-mt*-1_37.a ] ; then
  mkdir -p ~/ros/ros-deps
  cd ~/ros/ros-deps
  wget --tries=10 http://pr.willowgarage.com/downloads/boost_1_37_0.tar.gz
  tar xzf boost_1_37_0.tar.gz
  cd boost_1_37_0
  ./configure --prefix=/opt/ros
  make
  sudo make install
fi

if [ ! -f /opt/ros/lib/liblog4cxx.so.10 ] ; then
  mkdir -p ~/ros/ros-deps
  cd ~/ros/ros-deps
  wget --tries=10 http://pr.willowgarage.com/downloads/apache-log4cxx-0.10.0-wg_patched.tar.gz
  tar xzf apache-log4cxx-0.10.0-wg_patched.tar.gz
  cd apache-log4cxx-0.10.0
  ./configure --prefix=/opt/ros
  make
  sudo make install
fi
```

rosdep runs the bash script above and exits when complete.

h3: rosdistro/rosdep
Contents:

While [rosdep](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/rosdep#rosdep "http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/rosdep#rosdep") is the client tool, the reference is provided by rosdep rules, stored online in [ros/rosdistro/rosdep on github](https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/tree/master/rosdep "https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/tree/master/rosdep"). When doing 
```
$ rosdep update
```
rosdep actually retrieves the rules from the rosdistro github repository. * As of version 0.14.0 rosdep update will only fetch ROS package names for non-EOL ROS distributions. If you are still using an EOL [ROS distribution](/Distributions "/Distributions") (which you probably shouldn't) you can pass the argument --include-eol-distros to also fetch the ROS package names of those.

These rules are used when a dependency is listed that doesn't match the name of a ROS package built on the buildfarm. Then rosdep checks if there exists a rule to resolve it for the proper platform and package manager you are using. When creating a new package, you might need to declare new system dependencies to the [rosdep rules](https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/tree/master/rosdep "https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/tree/master/rosdep") if they are not there yet. Just edit the file, add the dependency needed (following a strict alphabetical order and a similar structure as the other dependencies already registered) and send a pull request. After that pull request has been merged, you need to run : 
```
$ rosdep update
```
and now that dependency will be resolved by rosdep. You can test it with : 
```
$ rosdep resolve my_dependency_name
```
The output should be something like : 
```
#apt
my-dependency-name
```
where the first line is the package manager chosen for installing this dependency, and the second line is the actual name for that dependency on your current platform.
